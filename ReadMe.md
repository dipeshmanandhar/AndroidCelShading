# Android Cel Shading
Android version of my Cel Shading project.

## Setting up
* This project follows this example: https://www.kuon.ch/post/2020-01-12-android-app/
    * But I use Groovy DSL instead of Kotlin DSL
* To create signed Release app, follow [these](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18328730/how-to-create-a-release-signed-apk-file-using-gradle) instructions.
